    It didn’t start like a movie.  
    Instead, it began with me being your asshole senior at the office!  
    You started as nothing more than a Junior to me and you ended up being my everything. ❤️
    Here's a literal cartoon of how we'd be in office below -

    Somewhere between being your shitty senior to late-night talks,  
    random smiles,  
    and missing you a little too much…  
    I fell for you, hard. ❤️

  <p>
    Dear Gul,<br><br>
    I don’t know when it happened —  
    there was no exact moment, no dramatic scene.  
    Just you slowly becoming my favorite thought every day.<br><br>

    In a world full of noise, you feel like peace.  
    Your smile feels like home,<br><br>

    This is just a note,  
    but my feelings for you are a whole series —  
    with no final episode planned.
    Thank you for being my peace, always! <br><br>

    Always & Forever yours,<br>
    <strong>Shehzada ❤️</strong>

  <h2>Season 2 Teaser</h2>
  <p>
    Somewhere between office banter, stolen glances,  
    and “just work” conversations, something changed.<br><br>

    What started as teasing turned into caring,  
    and before I realized it…  
    you became the part of my day I looked forward to the most. ❤️
